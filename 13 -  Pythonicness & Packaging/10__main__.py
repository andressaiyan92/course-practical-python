__main__


Most Python code is either a module to be imported, or a script that does something.
However, sometimes it is useful to make a file that can be both imported as a module and run as a script.
To do this, place script code inside if __name__ == "__main__".
This ensures that it won't be run if the file is imported.
Example:
"""
def function():
    print("This is a module function")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This is a script")

"""
When the Python interpreter reads a source file, 
it executes all of the code it finds in the file. Before executing the code, it defines a few special variables.
For example, if the Python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program,
 it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value "__main__". 
If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module's name.
"""
"""
If we save the code from our previous example as a file called sololearn.py, we can then import it to another script as a module, using the name sololearn.
> sololearn.py <-- this is the file name
def function():
   print("This is a module function")

if __name__=="__main__":
   print("This is a script")

> some_script.py <-- this is the file name
import sololearn
sololearn.function()

Result:
>>>
This is a module function
>>>
Basically, we've created a custom module called sololearn, and then used it in another script.
