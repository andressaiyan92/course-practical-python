Additional special sequences are \A, \Z, and \b.
The sequences \A and \Z match the beginning and end of a string, respectively.
The sequence \b matches the empty string between \w and \W characters, or \w characters
and the beginning or end of the string. Informally, it represents the boundary between words.
The sequence \B matches the empty string anywhere else.
Example:
"""
import re
pattern = r"\b(cat)\b"
match = re.search(pattern, "The cat sat!")
if match:
   print ("Match 1")

match = re.search(pattern, "We s>cat<tered?")
if match:
   print ("Match 2")

match = re.search(pattern, "We scattered.")
if match:
   print ("Match 3")

"""
\b(cat)\b" basically matches the word "cat" surrounded by word boundaries.
